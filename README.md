# PET Monte Carlo
Simulation and analysis code to accompany the paper (still to come...)

This repository includes scripts to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the Siemens Biograph 40 mCT PET/CT system using the GEANT4 application for tomographic emission (GATE).

## GATE simulations

## Analysis code

The code required to bin the root output into sinograms and reconstruct the images could not be made publicly available, so there is a slight jump from the GATE simulation outputs to the sinograms and images. Therefore, we have provided the data files for download.
